# Fake-news-detection-using-machine-learning
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on detecting fake news using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles as either real or fake.
By utilizing various natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, we aim to create a robust and reliable solution for identifying misleading 
or false information in news articles.
